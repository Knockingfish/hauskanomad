#### Cloning and running the project

Secondarily, clone the code from github:

```
git clone https://github.com/Knockingfish/hauskanomad.git
```

In the client (frontend) and server (backend) directories of the cloned project install the required dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Following this, the frontend and backend can be started allowing the project to be tested manually.

```
npm start
```

This command should be run in both the client and server directories.

There is a known bug in which the server entry point will generate an erroneous file named "5000;". It is recommend to check for and erase this file when (re)starting the backend.

How can I contribute?
---
The best way to contribute will be to fork the project and develop your version separately, as we are not accepting contributions currently.
