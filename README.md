How do I run this or work on this?
---
First the following software will be needed:
- A text editor.
  - VSCode.
  - Sublime Text.
  - Kate.
  - Kwrite.
  - Notepad.
  - Micro.
  - Nano.
- NodeJS.
- A way to test RESTFUL APIs.
    - cURL.

#### Cloning and running the project

```
git clone https://github.com/Knockingfish/hauskanomad.git
```

In the client (frontend) and server (backend) directories of the cloned project install the required dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Following this, the frontend and backend can be started allowing the project to be tested manually.

This command should be run in both the client and server directories.

```
npm start
```

The separation of backend and frontend in this way is a quirk of how this project was developed, and is unlikely to be resolved.

How can I contribute?
---
The best way to contribute will be to fork the project and develop your version separately, as we are not accepting contributions currently.
